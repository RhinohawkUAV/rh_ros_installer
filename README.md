# Installer for Rhinohawk ROS

This repo contains an installer for setting up a new system to run [Rhinohawk ROS](https://github.com/RhinohawkUAV/rh_ros). It's intended for provisioning fresh virtual machines and embedded devices. 

:warning: Use the installer at your own risk! :warning:

The installer will modify your system by installing many packages and checking out code into your home directory. 

We encourage you to read through the install script before running it.

## Running the installer

To begin the installation process, type:
```
./install.sh
```

You'll be prompted to begin the installation, and then periodically by sudo for your password to escalate privilege.
